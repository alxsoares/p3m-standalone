PURPOSE
=======================
This program calculates electrostatic interactions in many particle systems
using different algorithms. It does not have a name.

INSTALL
========================
To build execute "make" in the source directory.
Prerequesits to build are an mpicc in the PATH, fftw3, the gnu scientific
library and GNU make.

RUN
========================
The binary is called "p3m". It is controlled via command line parameters.
They should be somewhat selfexplanatory, but there is detailed documentation
below. They are of the form <key> [<value>], their order is arbitrary.

EXAMPLE
========================
./p3m particles 1000 box 10 mesh 16 cao 7 rcut 3.0 method 7 alphamin 0.1
alphamax 2.5 alphastep 0.05 system_type 5 

This generates a random system of 1000 particles of type 5 ( See system_type ) in a box of size 10^3.
It then calculates reference forces using an Ewald summation with machine precision, 
and executes the method no. 7 ( see methods ) a mesh of 16^3 interpolation
order 7 and real space cutoff 3.0 for all alphas from 0.1 to 2.5 with a
spacing of 0.05.


PARAMETERS
=======================

* rcut <cutoff>
The realspace cutoff.

* alphamin <alphamin>
The minimal alphavalue to calculate.

* alphamax <alphamax>
The maximal alphavalue to calculate.

* alphastep <alphastep>
The distance between alphas.

* { positions <position_filename> [ forces <forces_filename> ] | paritcles
<particles> box <box> [system_type <system_type] [ charge <charge> ] }
Either a position file to read the system configuration from, or the
parameters to generate one.

The system_types are
0   SYSTEM_RANDOM		uniformly distributed particles in the whole box.
1   SYSTEM_INNER_BOX		randomly placed particles within [0.25*box,0.75*box)^3.
2   SYSTEM_MADELUNG		A cubic cristall.
3   SYSTEM_SEPARATED_DIPOLE	Randomly placed extended dipoles with distance 1.
4   SYSTEM_GAUSSIAN		Gaussian distributed particles about the
center of the box.
5   SYSTEM_SLAB			Particles within [0.25*box,0.75*box)x[0,box)x[0,box) 
 
If charge is set, then the particles carry charge <charge> instead of unit charges.

The format of the position file is

# Teilchenzahl: <number_of_particles>
# Len: <box_length>
<x_1> <y_1> <z_1> <q_1>
...
<x_number_of_particles> <y_number_of_particles> <z_number_of_particles>
<q_number_of_particles>


If forces is given the reference forces are read from <forces_filename>,
the format is

<fx_1> <fy_1> <fz_1>
...
<fx_number_of_particles> <fy_number_of_particles> <fz_number_of_particles>


There have to be exactly as many lines in this file as there are particles
in the particle file. If forces is not set, the reference forces are
calculated.

* mesh <mesh_size>
The mesh size for the P3M methods.

* cao <cao>
The interpolation order for the various P3M methods.

* [mc <mc>]
The aliasing sum cutoff for the P3M influence function.

* [mc_est <mc_est>]
The aliasing sum cutoff for the P3M error estimate.

* method <method>
The method to use, where <method> is one of

0   P3M, ik differentiated, complex to complex, not interlaced.
1   P3M, ik differentiated, complex to complex, interlaced.
2   P3M, ad differentiated, complex to complex, not interlaced.
3   P3M, ad differentiated, complex to complex, interlaced.
4   Ewald summation.
6   P3M, ik differentiated, real to complex, not interlaced.
7   P3M, ad differentiated, real to complex, not interlaced.
